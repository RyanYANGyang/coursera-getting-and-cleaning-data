==================================
# project discription

This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data"

# About the raw data

The features (561 of them) are unlabeled and can be found in the x_test.txt. The activity labels are in the y_test.txt file. The test subjects are in the subject_test.txt file

The same holds for the training set.

# About the script and the tidy dataset

I should submit:
1. a tidy data set as described below
2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This file explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

This  script will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity. This tidy dataset will be written to a tab-delimited file called tidydata.txt, which can also be found in this repository.

# About the Code Book

The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
